# Stack-in-Python-Matching-brackets

As you have probably noticed, most code editors check if you used the right number of brackets in your code.

Write a simple brackets checker that, given a string, prints 'OK' if all the brackets are used correctly, and 'ERROR' otherwise.

Don't forget to check that the brackets are in the right order (opening before closing).

Hint

Each time you encounter an opening bracket '(', put it to the stack. Do the opposite when you encounter a closing bracket.
